@project: La Carte du Tendre du Web / The Web Tenderness Map

---
I. INTRODUCTION

This open source free web widget is developped as part of the Web Tenderness Map project (hosted at http://www.carte-du-tendre.com). This project aims to represent the current tenderness map as a websites network.

If many applications are already available to explore and visualize graphs (as Gephi and GexfExplorer), there is not a lot of ways to experience a local navigation of these graphs (the best example I know is the noticeable Moritz Stefaner's Relation Browser at http://moritz.stefaner.eu/projects/relation-browser/). This tool is particularly developped for the Gephi and GEXF users community, and the final functionnalities will contain for example: GEXF attributes visualisation, GEXF meta data visualisation, GEXF nodes size and color and edges thickness... Finally, a "GEXF version" of the Relation Browser.

And in the context of the Web Tenderness Map will be branched another version, with the same structure but a specific interface to this project (coming soon...).

III. FUNCTIONALITIES

- Already implemented:
  GexfWalker considers yet every graph as oriented (it will be changed soon). It displays the selected node at the center of the scene, with around it its neighbours, with arrows for edges.
  It doesn't display the self edges, but displays the reciprocal edges.
  If a node contains some attributes and if these attributes are valid, then the attributes are displayed (As attributes are displayed as html string, so if you use html in your attributes, you can change the display, the colors. Here are the specifications of AS3 TextField.htmlText: http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/text/TextField.html#htmlText). And if an attribute starts with the string 'http://', then it will be clickable (Ctrl+Click to open it in another tab).

- To be done:
 - Undirected graphs
 - Node size and edge size
 - Edges between the neighbors
 - A preloader (or more a preparser, actually)
 - Other kind of display when neighbors are too many (like some different circles)
 - Full graph display as the other view (the following visualization is amazing, GexfWalker should offer this later: http://www.weforum.org/documents/riskbrowser2010/risks/)

IV. HOW TO USE IT

The web application file is "bin-debug/GexfWalker.swf". You have to stock it somewhere, and put the following lines in your html code to make it appear:

<object width="1200" height="600" id="GexfWalker">
	<param name="movie" value="[SWF_FILE_FULL_PATH]?gexfPath=[GEXF_FILE_FULL_PATH]" />
	<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
	<param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />
	<embed src="[SWF_FILE_FULL_PATH]?gexfPath=[GEXF_FILE_FULL_PATH]" allowFullScreen="true" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="1200" height="600">
	</embed>
</object>

Obviously, you can modify the width, height and background color parameters as you wish. It is also recommanded to add the JS script available in "bin-debug/simple_example.html" to block the page scrolling when the mouse is over GexfWalker.

As with GexfExplorer, some parameters will be available to allow you to personalize the display/interface/whatever...

V. DEV LOG

- 03/02/2010:
    First functionnal version of GexfWalker. The start node is selected randomly, and you just can click on a neighbor to select it and see its neighbor etc...

- 03/04/2010:
    Now, the selection uses some effects on alpha values and Event.ENTER_FRAME stuff. So, it's really functional. Moreover, with the attributes display, it starts to be useful.

- 03/05/2010:
    Attributes, meta data and info visualisation are working, and a random reprocess button has been added.

- 05/10/2010:
    I just started a refactoring. The buggs of the control panel are already fixed. Next stage, implement the other view (see Functionnalities/to be done).

- 05/14/2010:
    Refactoring done
