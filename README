@project: La Carte du Tendre du Web / The Web Tenderness Map

---
I. INTRODUCTION

This open source free web widget is developped as part of the Web Tenderness Map project (hosted at http://www.carte-du-tendre.com). This project aims to represent the current tenderness map as a websites network.

If many applications are already available to explore and visualize graphs (as Gephi and GexfExplorer), there is not a lot of ways to experience a local navigation of these graphs (the best example I know is the noticeable Moritz Stefaner's Relation Browser at http://moritz.stefaner.eu/projects/relation-browser/). This tool is particularly developped for the Gephi and GEXF users community, and the final functionnalities will contain for example: GEXF attributes visualisation, GEXF meta data visualisation, GEXF nodes size and color and edges thickness... Finally, a "GEXF version" of the Relation Browser.

And in the context of the Web Tenderness Map will be branched another version, with the same structure but a specific interface to this project (coming soon...).

IV. HOW TO USE IT

The web application file is "bin-debug/GexfWalker.swf". You have to stock it somewhere, and put the following lines in your html code to make it appear:

<object width="1200" height="600" id="GexfWalker">
	<param name="movie" value="[SWF_FILE_FULL_PATH]?gexfPath=[GEXF_FILE_FULL_PATH]" />
	<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
	<param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />
	<embed src="[SWF_FILE_FULL_PATH]?gexfPath=[GEXF_FILE_FULL_PATH]" allowFullScreen="true" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="1200" height="600">
	</embed>
</object>

Obviously, you can modify the width, height and background color parameters as you wish. It is also recommanded to add the JS script available in "bin-debug/simple_example.html" to block the page scrolling when the mouse is over GexfWalker.

V. DEV LOG

- 3/2/2010:
    First functionnal version of GexfWalker. The start node is selected randomly, and you just can click on a neighbor to select it and see its neighbor etc...

- 4/2/2010:
    Now, the selection uses some effects on alpha values and Event.ENTER_FRAME stuff. So, it's really functional. Moreover, with the attributes display, it starts to be useful.
